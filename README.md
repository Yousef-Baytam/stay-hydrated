# React example with MindAR 

This is an example project of using [MindAR](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js) in React 

The react components are:

1. `src/mindar-viewer` (AFRAME version), and 
2. `src/mindar-three-viewer` (ThreeJS version). 

Everything else are created from `create-react-app`, and they are irrelevant.
